# StackOverflow API Test

## Description

`stackoverflowapi-test` is a test to fetch a list of StackOverflow users by their reputation and display the list on the screen.
It uses TailwindCSS for styling, React 18 and NextJS 13 with Typescript.
It is designed as a progressive web app in mind as it is just an app shell so that it can be easily bridged to Native.

- Offline first with in-memory caching
- Static export with NextJS
- Native support with Capacitor
